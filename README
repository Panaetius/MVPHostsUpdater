Automatically updates your hosts file using the MVPS hosts file (http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htm) at system startup.

Entries that aren't in the MVPS file are left untouched and added to the beginning of the hosts file in a custom entries section.

Project also includes an installer project that creates a backup of the original hosts file and restores it upon deinstallation (well sort of, still figuring out the details uf uninstalling)

Needs administrator privileges to run.

If you want another hosts file, you can update the url in the *.config file in the installation directory.

Cheers

P.s. you might need to change some settings in your antivirus to make this work
